    <h1>CS Dev Final Project Website</h1>

    <h2>TL;DR—The Basic Requirements</h2>

    <p>
      Instructors will create a hand-coded, dynamic website with
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>HTML</li>
      <li>CSS</li>
      <li>JavaScript</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>The Rationale</h2>

    <p>
      We want all instructors to have
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>knowledge and experience to bring into the classroom</li>
      <li>skills and projects to take with them after 9 Dots</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Building a website gives instructors a parallel learning path to their students: both are learning new and complex computational thinking. And the real-world nature of web development means the skills instructors learn (and the evidence that they learned it) will be useful beyond 9 Dots.
    </p>

    <h3>A Note on Computational Thinking</h3>

    <p>
      Working on a significant project will exercise <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/zp92mp3/revision/1">computational thinking</a>. HTML and CSS alone will require organization and attention to detail, which tie into computational thinking elements like <strong>decomposition</strong>, <strong>pattern recognition</strong>, and <strong>abstraction</strong>. Adding JavaScript to the mix will take those to another level, and add <strong>algorithms</strong> to the mix.

    <h2>The Timeline</h2>

    <ul class="timeline">
      <li><span class="timeline-moment">June</span> After classes end, make use of your jump in available time to focus on your project.</li>
      <li><span class="timeline-moment">mid-June</span> We highly suggest you meet with your coach for feedback you can act on before the showcase. You can of course meet more than that, schedules permitting.</li>
      <li><span class="timeline-moment">end of June</span> Show off your project, and be inspired by others, at the instructor project showcase!</li>
      <li><span class="timeline-moment">July</span> Meet with coaches to formally review your code and determine next steps in your CS development journey.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQ</h2>

    <h3 class="question">
      Really, those are the only requirements? I won’t be dinged for doing only the basics?
    </h3>
    <p class="answer">
      This project intentionally has simple base requirements. Our hope is that this high flexibility leads to high personal investment—which allows you to find an area where you can challenge yourself, and then <em>rise to that challenge</em>. And the more you push yourself, the more we can use that experience to help you figure out where you might grow next in your CS development journey.
    </p>

    <h3 class="question">
      What do you mean by <em>dynamic</em> website?
    </h3>
    <p class="answer">
      We mean that via user interaction, the contents of the website itself change. Using something like a <code>:hover</code> CSS pseudo-class to temporarily change the appearance of something on a website does not count, because it only changes the presentation. Using JavaScript to change CSS classes on a website element in response to a button press does count, as does using JavaScript to insert/delete/modify website content. Please note: a dynamic website <em>requires</em> JavaScript.*
    </p>
    <p class="footnote">
      *Unless you want to do <a href="https://notlaura.com/is-css-turing-complete/">something hardcore</a>.
    </p>

    <h3 class="question">
      Must <em>I</em> write all my website code <em>from scratch</em>?
    </h3>
    <p class="answer">
      We expect that you will use and modify code from other sources. We just ask that you attribute those sources. Your portions of the code, though, should be significant enough that you can call the entire project <em>yours</em>.
    </p>

    <h2>Nice-to-Haves</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>host your website online</li>
      <li>manage your source code via Git</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Both of the above may come together via a tool like <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>.
